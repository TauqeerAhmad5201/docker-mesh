Difference b/w virtualization and containerization. 

- In virtualization - hardware will be used from the system and will be fixed for every OS we install through the hypervisor
- In containerisation - hardware will be used from the system but will not be fixed, it will be allocated for the time it is being used. 


Docker uses OS level containerization.
